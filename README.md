# Save the Lost Ones

This is a game where you are a robot saving lost souls.  
In the game, you try to collect a coin first, and with the coin you can save a lost soul.  
But beware, if you do not have a coin with you, the lost souls can get you and you will fall into darkness.   
With every collected coin and saved soul, lost souls will go more berserk.
